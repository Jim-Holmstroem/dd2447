In all cases you are supposed to provide as sound algorithms of the types
described in the course.
Summing over exponentially many terms and other
solutions that always gives exponential time, will not be considered
sufficient.
\begin{exercise}{2} MAP switch setting and position on model railway \\ 
Imagine a model railway with a single train. You know the map of the tracks
including the position of all the switches, but you don't know current states
of the switches, or where the train is currently located. Each switch has three
connections: $\left\{0,L,R\right\}$. If the train comes from the direction of
$L$ or $R$, it always
leaves in the direction $0$. If the train comes from the direction $0$, it will
leave in either direction $L$ or $R$, depending on the state of the switch. The
switch has prior probability $1/2$ for each direction, but will remain the same
throughout the train run. You are receiving a stream of signals from the train,
each signal specifying the direction in which train has passed a switch: 
$\left\{0L,0R,L0,R0\right\}$; you do not know, however, 
which switch the train has passed.
Also, the sensors are noisy, and with a certain probability $p$, the train
reports a random signal instead of a real direction in which it passed the
switch.

Given the map of the railroad and a sequence of switch signals
$\left\{ y_i \right\}_1^T$. Your task is to compute MAP switch and current
position.
